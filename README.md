## Architecture

Sandpiper follows a modern microservices architecture:

- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 with Quasar Framework
- **Backend**: Flask with RESTful API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for email notifications
- **Email Service**: Mailjet integration
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sandpiper.git
cd sandpiper
```

2. **Backend Setup**

```bash
cd Sandpiper-backend
# Create .env.secrets file with necessary credentials
# The .env.secrets.example file shows required variables

# Start the backend services
sudo ./run.sh
```

3. **Frontend Setup**

```bash
cd Sandpiper-frontend
npm install
npx quasar dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:9001 (or another port if 9001 is in use).

## Security and Authentication

The application implements robust authentication and security measures:

- **Protected Routes**: All application routes (except login, signup, and password reset) require authentication
- **Automatic Redirection**: Unauthenticated users attempting to access protected routes are automatically redirected to the login page
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with expiration
- **API Security**: All API endpoints that handle user data or todos require valid authentication tokens

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available via Swagger UI at:
```
http://localhost:5000/api-doc
```

This interactive documentation allows you to:
- Browse all available API endpoints
- See required parameters and response formats
- Test API endpoints directly from the browser

## Integration Testing

Sandpiper includes comprehensive integration tests for all Todo CRUD operations. These tests ensure the API endpoints work correctly and maintain data integrity.

### Running Integration Tests

To run the complete integration test suite:

```bash
cd Sandpiper-backend
./run_integration_tests.sh
```

### Test Coverage

The integration tests cover all Todo API endpoints:

1. **Create Todo Test** üìù
   - Creates todos with various data combinations
   - Tests required field validation
   - Verifies proper data storage and retrieval

2. **Read Todos Test** üìñ
   - Retrieves all todos for authenticated users
   - Tests filtering by status (all, active, completed)
   - Verifies individual todo retrieval by ID
   - Confirms proper access control

3. **Update Todo Test** ‚úèÔ∏è
   - Updates todo title, description, and due date
   - Tests completion status changes
   - Verifies toggle completion functionality
   - Ensures proper validation and error handling

4. **Delete Todo Test** üóëÔ∏è
   - Deletes individual todos
   - Verifies todos are completely removed
   - Tests deletion of non-existent todos
   - Confirms proper cleanup and list updates

### Test Features

- **üîê Authentication Testing**: Each test creates a unique user and obtains JWT tokens
- **üß™ Isolated Tests**: Tests don't interfere with each other
- **üìä Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed success/failure reporting with emojis
- **üìù Detailed Logging**: All test runs are logged to `logs/` directory
- **‚ö° Parallel Execution**: Tests run efficiently with proper error handling

### Prerequisites for Testing

Before running integration tests, ensure:

1. **Backend is Running**:
   ```bash
   cd Sandpiper-backend
   sudo ./run.sh
   ```

2. **Python Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install requests
   ```

3. **Database is Initialized**: The backend should be fully started with database migrations applied

### Test Output

The test runner provides:
- Real-time progress with emojis and colors
- Step-by-step execution logs
- Success rate calculations
- Detailed failure analysis
- Recommendations for fixing issues

Example successful run:
```
